<h2 class="subhead">Latex</h2>

<p>A few of you have asked me how you can use latex on your own computers.  This page describes (to the best of my knowledge) the best tools to use on Windows and Mac.  With these tools you won't need to use the command line, but try and stick with the concept of the working directory, with all related files living in the same directory.</p>

<p>If you're a PhD student in statistics, I'd suggest you spend some time getting familiar with these tools as you will be using them a lot.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Latex: <a href="http://miktex.org/">miktex</a> (~600 meg)</li>
  <li>Text editor: <a href="http://www.winedt.com/">winedt</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.winedt.com/tex.html">Using miktex and winedt together</a> (this means you don't need to run anything from the command line).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mac</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Latex: <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">mactex</a> (1.15 gig)</li>
  <li>Text editor: <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html">TeXShop</a>, included in mactex.</li>
</ul>
