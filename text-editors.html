<h2 class="subhead">Text editors</h2>

<p>My text editor is the one tool that I use the most. I use it for writing R code, latex, web pages, ruby scripts and for taking notes. Text files have the great advantage that you can always read them - you never have to rely on having purchased some software.</p>

<p>A small amount of effort learning the features of your text editor can provide great dividends. I would suggest that you try and figure out if your text editor can do each of the following tasks, and what the keyboard shortcut is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bulk comment the selected lines</li>
  <li>Indent/dedent</li>
  <li>Send the current line or selected text to R</li>
</ul>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>Open linux, I recommend that you use gedit, which can be opened from the command line with <code>gedit filename &amp;</code>.</p>

<p>To configure it for maximum compatibility with our R style, open Edit | Preferences and then make sure the settings match those in <a href="gedit-set-up.pdf">this pdf</a>.</p>

<h2>Mac</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Free: smultron</a></li>
  <li>Pay: textmate</li>
  <li>For latex: texshop, included in the tex distribution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Winedt</li>
  <li>
</ul>
