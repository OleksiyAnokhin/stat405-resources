\noindent Write a simple function in R for each of the following tasks. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the sum of a numeric vector (without using \verb!sum()!).
\item Find the mean of a numeric vector (without using \verb!mean()!).
\item Find the variance of a numeric vector (without using \verb!var()!).
\item Automatically create a scatterplot matrix with the variables in a given data frame.
\item Automatically create a histogram of a vector.
\item Automatically create a histogram of a vector with the given number of bins.
\item Find the least common multiple of two numbers.
\item Test whether a number is even.
\item Test whether a number is odd.
\item If a number is odd add one to it.
\item If any number in a numeric vector is odd, add one to it
\item Test whether a number is an integer.
\item Separate the integer and decimal parts of a number, return them in a vector of length two.
\item Return the given vector with all NA's and NULL's removed..
\item Return the rows of a data frame that contain NA's.
\item Return the row numbers of rows in a data frame that contain NA's.
\item Divide each element in a numeric vector by the vector's length.
\item Create a new vector by repeating a given vector a given number of times.
\item Double each element in a vector (e.g., turn \emph{a,b,c,...} into \emph{a, a, b, b, c,...}).
\item Find the mean of a vector that contains one or more NA's by ignoring any NA's (without using \verb!mean()!).
\item Randomly return one of the following phrases, "Ace", "King" or "Queen" with equal probability of returning each.
\item Randomly return one of the following phrases, "Ace", "King" or "Queen" with twice as much probability of returning "Ace" as either "King" or "Queen."
\item Save the current graph with width = 6 and height = 6 as a pdf with the inputted name.
\item Identify whether an object is a logical, character, or numeric object.
\item Return the number of unique sequences that can be made from an inputted vector (caution: don't use large vectors).
\item Return the number of unique sets that can be made from an inputted vector.
\item Return whichever the entered number is closest to: 0 or 1000.
\item Return the area of a circle with the given radius.
\item Return the circumference, area (of a cross-section along a diameter), and volume of a sphere with the given radius. Each should be labelled in the functions output.
\item Given a data frame with two columns, return all of the combinations of the two variables that occur once or more.
\item Automatically plot the above results with each variable on an axis and the number of occurrences (counts) represented by color.
\item Create a new vector where each \emph{ith} element is the sum of the first \emph{i} elements of the given vector.
\item List all of the permutations of a (short) vector.
\item Display the number of groups of size n can be made from the inputted vector of length k.
\item Given the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial, return the roots.
\item Return the lowest positive value of a vector
\item Return the second lowest positive value of a vector
\item Select the number in a vector that is the greatest distance from twice the vectors mean
\item Return whether a vector of numbers is right skewed or left skewed by comparing its mean and median.
\item Find the mode of a vector.
\item Index a series of observations by the first observation (hint: express each observation as a percentage of the first observation).
\item Find the determinant of a four by four matrix.
\item Given a numeric vector of length 10, determine which element occurs at the 70th percentile.
\item Save a copy of a data frame as a comma separated values file whose filename is the name of the data frame plus ".csv"
\item Save a copy of a data frame as a comma separated values file whose filename is the name of the data frame plus ".csv". Have the file be saved in a new folder named "test" within the working directory.
\item Return a vector with its elements reordered in a random manner.
\item Return a vector with its elements ordered from smallest to largest.
\item Return a vector with its elements ordered largest to smallest.





\end{enumerate}
