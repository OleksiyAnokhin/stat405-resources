<h2>Text editors</h2>

<p>R comes with a built in text editor, but you might want a more fully featured text editor.</p>

<p>I'd recommend <a href="http://www.winedt.com/">Winedt</a>, which costs $40 (cheaper than a textbook!), because it integrates well with latex and R. install RWinEdit, by running <code>install.packages("RWinEdt")</code> within R. When you want to edit R files, run <code>library(RWinEdt)</code> in R. You might also want to read an <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~aeggers/RWinEdt_installation.pdf">introduction to RWinEdit</a>.</p>
